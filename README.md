# BI Professional Certificate Overview
The BI Professional Certificate includes three courses:

## Foundations of Business Intelligence (BI)
This course introduces the basics of a BI team in a corporate setting. It covers the roles within a BI team, stages of a BI project, and key skills for a successful BI analyst. You'll also create essential documents for a chosen scenario (Cyclistic or Google Fiber), including stakeholder, project, and strategy requirements, before diving into a BI project.

## The Path to Insights: Data Models and Pipelines
This course explores how data flows from source to destination. It covers SQL techniques for optimizing databases using BigQuery, ETL processes, and data integrity. While focused on data engineering, it’s valuable for understanding how BI and data analyst roles collaborate in a corporate environment.

## Decisions, Decisions: Dashboards and Reports
This course focuses on data visualization and dashboard creation to address business problems. It emphasizes the importance of mockups for feedback, presenting insights to stakeholders, and offers tips for building a BI portfolio, writing resumes, and applying for BI roles.


## Project Scope:
In this BI project, I’ll apply skills across BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor to Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in NYC.

### Stakeholders & Team:

**Stakeholders:** Sara Romero (Marketing), Ernest Cox (Product Development), Jamal Harris (Customer Data), Nina Locklear (Procurement)<br/>
**Team Members & Primary Contacts:** Adhira Patel (API Strategist), Megan Pirato (Data Warehousing Specialist), Rick Andersson (Data Governance Manager), Tessa Blackwell (Data Analyst), Shareefah Hakimi (Project Manager), with other team members involved.
### Data & Requirements:

**Datasets:** NYC Citi Bike Trips and Census Bureau US Boundaries<br/>
**Focus Areas:** Customer growth insights, demand patterns by location, and user types (subscribers vs. non-subscribers)<br/>
**Key Goals:** Understand customer usage, optimize station locations, explore bike demand, and identify seasonality trends. The dashboard should be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech options.
### Project Deliverables:

Visualizations showing trip trends by location, popular destinations, congestion, peak usage by time and weather, and year-over-year growth. <br/>
Maps and tables to explore starting/ending stations, along with net bike movements to capture station congestion.
### Timeline:

**Week 1:** Dataset and design validation <br/>
**Weeks 2-3:** SQL and ETL development <br/>
**Weeks 3-4:** Dashboard design and peer review <br/>
**Weeks 5-6:** Final development and testing <br/>
### Success Metrics:
Analyze data spanning a year to assess trends by location, seasonality, weather, and user type. The findings will inform customer demand and growth strategies.
### Additional Notes:

- Data will be anonymized for privacy.<br/>
- Weather data will be considered, even without specific times for precipitation.<br/>
- Geographic data aggregation will be supplemented with external data.<br/>

This project aims to deliver actionable insights to drive Cyclistic’s customer growth and inform strategic decisions on station placements.
